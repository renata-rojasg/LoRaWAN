This repository contains the R implementations of paper entitled ``Forecasting LoRaWAN RSSI using weather parameters: a comparative study of ARIMA, artificial intelligence and hybrid approaches'', which is submitted to Computer Networks, ISSN: 1872-7069. In the paper, we examine if weather parameters can play a role in accurately forecasting the RSSI measurements leveraging on the dataset provided by Goldoni et al. (2022). To this aim, we use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), artificial intelligence and hybrid approaches to forecasting the RSSI using weather parameters as regressors.
