# LoraWAN Forecasting LoRaWAN indicators using weather parameters: a comparative study of ARIMA and hybrid approaches

We examine if weather parameters can play a role in accurately forecasting the RSSI measurements leveraging on the dataset provided by Goldoni et al. (2022). To this aim, we use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and hybrid approaches to forecasting the RSSI using weather parameters as regressors.
